Tribes of the Sea inhabit Runeterra's seas and oceans, able to survive in depths untouched by humans. As a result of living in the oceans, separate from human intervention, they are the most in-touch with Runeterra's natural magic—flowing in its watery depths. They tend to be the least human-like in appearance, needing aquatic traits like gills and fins to thrive in water environments. Tribes of the Sea include the mermen-like Marai, the Makara, and the Raylu.
