            <p class="flavor">Transformed by an ancient, divine disc or merged with a celestial power, the Ascended are elevated beyond their mortal states into legendary, powerful beings. Physically, they are indelibly evolved, made more powerful, more swift, and more resilient. Their minds are changed as well; indeed, due to their exalted station, they are concerned with matters far above the day-to-day matters of mortals. From protecting the noble tenets of justice and truth to pursuing world-ending revenge, the nature of an individual Ascended depends on their life as a mortal and the nature of their Ascension. No matter the motivation, the presence of an Ascended points to universe-altering events to come.</p>
            <h4>Beyond Mortal Bounds</h4>
            <p>Extremely rare, the Ascended are some of the most powerful beings to roam Runeterra. With inhuman speed, strength, and stamina, the Ascended are called to commit themselves to otherworldly, far-reaching causes.</p>
            <p>The physical form of such a being shows undeniable evidence of their Ascension. The Shuriman Ascended fuse with the image of an animal, assuming a beastly and noble quality. The Targonian Ascended, though human in likeness, may have characteristics that reveal the celestial that resides within them. For instance, Leona, the Aspect of the Sun, seems to physically shine with the power of the Sun, and her eyes burn with its brightness. The Darkin warp the bodies of their mortal hosts, slowly decaying the form through corrupt energy and blood magic.</p>
            <p>Although immune to most natural causes of death, the Ascended can be defeated in some manner. Particular weapons and magics exist that can maim or kill Shuriman and Targonian Ascended, and the Darkin can be sealed within their weapons so long as they are without a host.</p>
            <h4>Ascended names</h4>
            <p>As both the Shuriman Ascended and the Darkin reached Ascension during the reign of the Shuriman Empire, their names are based in the Ancient Shuriman language. The Darkin, according to their leader Aatrox, frequently have doubled vowels in their names. The Targonian Ascended tend to keep their mortal, mundane names rather than assume the identity of the celestial aspect within them (see Targonian Humans).</p>
            <p>
                <span class="feature">Shuriman Names:</span>
                Az'ravi, Bahatek, Esh'kai, Ishtaka, Nacrath, Nixa, Retekta, Sek'riza, Xeyush
                <br />
                <span class="feature">Darkin Names:</span>
                Aalrut, Ceheltox, Khaal, Ma'almar, Nek'xast, Rhelaas, Seltaava, Shalteeya, Taltarus, Virresh, Xuust

            </p>
            <h4>Ascended traits</h4>
            <p>Your Ascended character has the following traits:</p>
            <p class="indent">
                <strong>
                    <em>Ability Score Increase</em>
                </strong>
                Your Dexterity score increases by 2.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <strong>
                    <em>Age</em>
                </strong>
                Prior to becoming Ascended, these beings age according to their mortal life. After Ascension, their aging slows and their natural lifespans are drastically increased, spanning millennia.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <strong>
                    <em>Alignment</em>
                </strong>
                The Ascended are steadfast in their ambitions; without personal appetite and vigor, their Ascension would undoubtedly fail. As such, they are rarely of totally neutral alignments. Targonian Ascended tend toward good alignments, while Darkin tend toward evil.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <strong>
                    <em>Size</em>
                </strong>
                Some retain their human frame when becoming Ascended, and others are altered in size and shape after the transformation. As such, Ascended vary from about 5 feet to over 7 feet tall. Your size is Medium.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <strong>
                    <em>Speed</em>
                </strong>
                Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <strong>
                    <em>Ascended Endurance</em>
                </strong>
                When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <strong>
                    <em>Languages</em>
                </strong>
                You can speak, read, and write Va-Nox.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <strong>
                    <em>Subrace</em>
                </strong>
                The different processes of Ascension divides the Ascended into Shuriman Ascended and Targonian Ascended. From there, the Darkin are formerly Shuriman Ascended who have been corrupted through war and betrayal. Choose one of these subraces.

            <p>Millennia ago, during the height of the Shuriman Empire, Shuriman warriors of exceptional loyalty and ability had been selected for a rite known as the Ritual of Ascension. Through the power of an ancient, colossal artifact known as the Sun Disc of Shurima, these warriors had been imbued with mystic energy.Based on the ideals they uphold and Shurima's culture of symbolism, they are merged with an aligning animalistic spirit. These beings harbor great physical strength, stature, and resilience. Indeed, when the sun had not yet set on the Empire of Shurima, these beings made up an Ascended legion, the Sunborn, charged with protecting Shurima and Azir.</p>
            <p>In the days of the empire's decline, the Ritual of Ascension had failed with greater frequency. Unsuccessful Ascensions either killed those who participated in the ceremony or produced failed, scarred Ascended called Baccai. Furthermore, most of the Ascended of ancient times had been destroyed in battles with the Void and in civil wars. Nonetheless, the recent resurrection of the Shuriman emperor Azir and his following Ascension reveals that the</p>
            <p>Sun Disc may yet claim the worthy for its sacred transformation.</p>

            <p>The peak of Mount Targon exudes celestial power. The apex is the apparent portal between the physical world and Targon Prime, a celestial realm where beings known as Aspects live. But the mountain is nigh impossible to scale. Hidden by a layer of clouds, its rocky paths shift constantly—the land itself altered by a higher magic. Even reaching the top of the mountain is not a guarantee of one's success. Some may find empty ruins at the mountaintop, reflecting their soul's unworthiness. The ascent is the ultimate challenge of one's endurance, skill, dedication, and spirit.</p>
            <p>Most mortals lose their lives in the climb. But for the few that make it—and for the fewer that the mountain finds worthy—they are rewarded with heavenly magic. The stellar Aspects, who embody concepts and constellations, may bestow some of their power unto a deserving mortal. Or, the Aspect may even fuse with a mortal, leaving the celestial plane and elevating the mortal into an almighty host.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Once god-warriors in the Ascended legion of the ancient Shuriman Empire, the Darkin are Ascended who have fallen far from grace. Several horrors and betrayals led to their irreversible corruption.</p>
            <p>Fighting off the Void from consuming Runeterra exposed them to unspeakable abominations and catastrophic brutality. The fall of the emperor Azir and the collapse of the empire caused infighting in the Ascended legion, leaving many to feel purposeless, adrift. In this conflict between the Ascended, known as the Darkin War, those that would become the Darkin developed blood magic, forming and reforming their bodies. This war raged over Runeterra, with the Darkin taking countless mortal lives to fuel their magic and heal their wounds.</p>
            <p>But ultimately, the Darkin were sealed away due to the intervention of the Targonians, particularly the Aspect of Twilight, a Targonian Ascended. The Aspect of Twilight taught mortals the magic necessary to entrap Darkin beings within their own weapons, if not outright destroyed. The Darkin War ended with the Darkin being suppressed and scattered; as centuries passed, the knowledge of their world-ending existence and capabilities fell into obscurity. But in recent times, mortals have found these once-hidden weapons and sought to wield them—potentially reviving these apocalyptic beings. When a mortal picks up a Darkin weapon, they are almost always instantly destroyed, their body overtaken and morphed into the Darkin’s physical host.</p>

                The Darkin created and perfected the arcane power of blood magic, called hemomancy. As a bonus action, you can use this knowledge to heal your wounds for 1d6 + CHA hit points. After you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you complete a long rest. The dice changes when you reach certain levels.

                All existing Darkin are inseparably tied to their weapon of choice. You are proficient in this weapon. In order to roam the world, the Darkin requires a mortal to take hold of the weapon and become their host. In doing so, the host's mind and identity are erased, and their body becomes possessed by the Darkin. The weapon must remain within 10 feet of the Darkin at all times. Without a host, the Darkin’s consciousness is plunged in darkness, without the ability to see or feel until another mortal attempts to wield them.
