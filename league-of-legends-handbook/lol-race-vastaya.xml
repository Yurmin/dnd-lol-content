            <p class="flavor">
				Tribes set in the deep wilderness, animalistic features and temperaments, innate connection with Runeterra's magic; the vastayan peoples are unified in these traits. However, the vastaya are diverse and far-reaching, just as the tides of nature itself are chaotic and uncontrollable.
            </p>
            <h4>
				Blood of the Wild
            </h4>
            <p>
				The vastaya have differing degrees of animal-like features. Some appear more human-like, with few chimeric traits to distinguish them from their mortal peers. Others are fully animal in appearance. Some even develop combinations of distinct animal characteristics, embodying amalgamations of bestial characteristics in a single body.
            </p>
            <p>
				Depending on the tribe and connection to ancient magic, vastaya have various levels of shapeshifting ability. Most vastaya maintain a shape that incorporates both animal and humanoid features, with special care for matching the animal ancestry of their tribe (for instance, a vastaya of the reptilian Strig tribe would likely retain their reptilian features.)
            </p>
            <h4>
				Ancient Heritage
            </h4>
            <p>
				Vastaya trace their lineage to ancient times, particularly to the intermingling of humans and a primeval race called the Vastayashai’rei. As legend states, the Vastayashai’rei originated in the First Lands, which would come to be called Ionia. In a primordial war with titans who rained hell from the skies above, the Vastayashai’rei absorbed the land's natural and spiritual magic into their bodies, becoming vastly powerful.
            </p>
            <p>
				Thousands upon thousands of years after this war, the vastaya emerged as descendants of these ancient peoples. The vastaya evolved into different brances and tribes, forming their own societies, languages, and civilizations across Runeterra. Now, most vastayan tribes reside in Ionia, a land which still carries inherent magic that gives the life to the vastaya.
            </p>
            <h4>
				Vastaya names
            </h4>
            <p>
				Vastayan names are typically drawn from the vastayan language, but some might be based in Ionian script. Names are given at birth, by parents or by tribe elders, depending on clan traditions.

            Tribes of the Sea inhabit Runeterra's seas and oceans, able to survive in depths untouched by humans. As a result of living in the oceans, separate from human intervention, they are the most in-touch with Runeterra's natural magic—flowing in its watery depths. They tend to be the least human-like in appearance, needing aquatic traits like gills and fins to thrive in water environments. Tribes of the Sea include the mermen-like Marai, the Makara, and the Raylu.
