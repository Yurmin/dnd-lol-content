        <description>
            <p class="flavor">Spirits long precede the existence of human societies and history. Tied intrinsically to realms beyond mortal understanding, spirits are mystical and magical. Spirits draw some sustenance from the mortal world, though that sustenance takes different forms and extents. Demons, for instance, survive on negative aspects of mortal experience, gorging on the resulting manic, charged energy. Meanwhile, Yordles sometimes seek mortal companionship out of natural sociability. In either case, spirits bring supernatural influence to Runeterra.</p>
            <h4>Drawn to Emotion</h4>
            <p>Some spirits, particularly demons, are born directly from mortal emotion—embodying strong, collective feelings like fear, rage, sorrow, or desire. Others might be summoned by arcanists or cultists, and these spirits may then rely on mortal temptation and ensnarement for survival.</p>
            <p>Other spirits, like yordles, may come from their enchanted homeland of Bandle City out of admiration or curiosity regarding the physical world. These more pleasant of these spirits tend to be genial, contributing to human societies and advancements. The more unpleasant of these spirits, however, might be more impish and potentially harmful.</p>
            <h4>Predator and Prey</h4>
            <p>For different reasons, spirits are often considered unwelcome in Runeterra's civilizations. Demons are abhorred as horrid predators, and mythos often emerges about these demonic menaces. As such, these spirits rarely engage in human affairs, instead preferring the cover of night to find isolated victims.</p>
            <p>Yordles, with their unnatural appearance or their less-than-predictable motives, are frequently considered threats to some human societies. Some extremists have taken to hunting yordles without exception. However, some of these spirits have utilized their magic and ingenuity to create glamours. This allows them to appear much more palatable to society and continue interacting with the mortal world.</p>
            <h4>Spirit names</h4>
            <p>The names of spirits do not follow the traditional naming conventions of mortals. Demon names typically stem from what mortals might call them, giving their fears or anxieties identity and physical form. Or, a demon might choose a name from past victims, assuming a different name as time goes on. Contrastingly, yordle names tend to sound friendly and welcoming, with double letters or simple syllabic counts.</p>
            <p>
                <span class="feature">Demonic Names:</span>
                Asha, Damethus, Faltas, Redmurne, Yeboros
                <br />
                <span class="feature">Yordle Names:</span>
                Bicey, Cheelie, Eearey, Fayan, Grari, Jilni, Ledrey, Meevo, Pimmer, Perret, Wultz, Yorro, Zefo
                <br />
            </p>
            <h4>Spirit traits</h4>
            <p>Your spirit character has the following traits:</p>
            <p class="indent">
                <strong>
                    <em>Ability Score Increase</em>
                </strong>
                Your Charisma score increases by 2.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <strong>
                    <em>Age</em>
                </strong>
                Spirits age at a much slower rate than humans, and their lifespans are drastically higher, lasting millennia.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <strong>
                    <em>Alignment</em>
                </strong>
                Spirits can be wily and unpredictable; as such, they are rarely of lawful alignments. Demons are often evil in alignment, while yordles tend toward good.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <strong>
                    <em>Size</em>
                </strong>
                Spirit forms vary. If you are a demon, your size is Medium. If you are a yordle, your size is Small.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <strong>
                    <em>Speed</em>
                </strong>
                Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <strong>
                    <em>Living Spirit</em>
                </strong>
                You are immune to disease. You do not need to eat, but you can ingest food and drink if you wish. Also, instead of sleeping, you enter a sleep-like state. You need to remain in it for only 4 hours each day. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <strong>
                    <em>Mystical Awareness</em>
                </strong>
                You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <strong>
                    <em>Spirit Realm's Refuge</em>
                </strong>
                As an action, you can teleport into a pocket of the Spirit Realm. The pocket is about 20 x 20 feet, and you can remain there for one hour. When the hour ends or when you choose, you teleport back to the exact location you were in prior to entering the Spirit Realm, or in the nearest unoccupied space. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete three long rests.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <strong>
                    <em>Languages</em>
                </strong>
                You can speak, read, and write Va-Nox and Sylvan, the language of the Spirit Realm.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <strong>
                    <em>Subraces</em>
                </strong>
                Spirits are generally divided into two groups. Demons are malevolent, feasting on the turbulent emotions or desires of mortals. Yordles tend to be more amiable, traversing Runeterra with wellmeant mischief. Choose one of these subraces.

            <p>The appearance of a demon differs wildly. Some accounts claim to have seen a humanoid catfish haunting the gambling halls of Bilgewater. Other legends abound of a lustful demoness who takes whatever form her targets find desirable. Less powerful demons might assume a physical form with which to interact with mortals. Upon the destruction of that form, the spirit returns to the Spirit Realm for recuperation.</p>
            <p>Unholy dwellers of darkness, demons wander the world in search of mortals to make prey. While the intentions demons hold can be hard to pinpoint, they can be assumed to be evil in nature. After all, their specialty might be in consuming and corrupting souls.</p>
