            <p class="flavor">In a land as rich in magic and technology as Runeterra, people have utilized such tools to create constructions. Furthermore, the innate power of the natural world sometimes births sentient constructs, made up of the raw materials from the runic wild. These beings, collectively known as golems, often commit themselves to the service of others. Indeed, the existence of some golems are predicated upon the completion of tasks granted by others. Whether it be undying loyalty to the master who created them, or an exclusive sense of duty to the land from which they emerged, a golem can be counted upon for their unflinching dedication.</p>
            <h4>Constructions, Categorized</h4>
            <p>The classifications of golems can be specified further. Golems made of machinery and technology, also known as robots, are programmed by the realm's best artificers and technomancers. Other golems can be crafted from more natural substances, like flora and rocks imbued with magic.</p>
            <p>While most of these golems have a single master who can be credited with their creation, golems also emerge naturally in the wild. These golems, called sentinels or stone-golems, vary in area of origin and level of sentience. They might be founded from the arcane, living rocks of Ionia to the petrified bark found in Valoran. However, such beings are more comparable to beasts in terms of intelligence.</p>
            <h4>Golem names</h4>
            <p>As constructions, golems do not follow the same naming conventions as their human counterparts. Inorganic golems are given a name by their creator. Organic golems often derive their names from the materials of which they are created.</p>
            <p>
                <span class="feature">Golem Names:</span>
                Beltrite, Cancrite, Duopsion, Incron, Ionase, Kogatz, Mannabar, Marevite, Noremite, Phoelite, Resphur, Sovalt, Surasite, Valile
                <br />
            </p>
            <h4>Golem traits</h4>
            <p>Your golem character has the following traits:</p>
            <p class="indent">
                <strong>
                    <em>Ability Score Increase</em>
                </strong>
                Your Strength score increases by 2.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <strong>
                    <em>Age</em>
                </strong>
                Golems are not born as mortals are, and they do not age as mortals do. They are constructed, so your character's age is based upon when you were created or emerged from the wild.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <strong>
                    <em>Alignment</em>
                </strong>
                Golems, especially inorganic golems, are generally programmed to carry out the will of their creators. Therefore, they tend toward lawful alignments.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <strong>
                    <em>Size</em>
                </strong>
                The most powerful golems—particularly those constructed by legendary artificers or borne of fabled, magical sources—may tower above mortals. However, most appear more human-like in size. Your size is Medium.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <strong>
                    <em>Speed</em>
                </strong>
                Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <strong>
                    <em>Living Construct</em>
                </strong>
                Even though you were constructed, you are a living creature. You are immune to disease. You do not need to eat, drink, or breathe. Instead of sleeping, you enter an inactive state for 4 hours each day. You do not dream in this state; you are fully aware of your surroundings and notice approaching enemies and other events as normal.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <strong>
                    <em>Natural Armor</em>
                </strong>
                You have an armor bonus of +1 when wearing armor. When you are not wearing armor, your AC is equal to 10 + your natural armor bonus + your dexterity modifier.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <strong>
                    <em>Languages</em>
                </strong>
                You can speak, read, and write Va-Nox.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <strong>
                    <em>Subraces</em>
                </strong>
                Golems can be separated into two subraces, based on their source and materials from which they are made. These categories are inorganic golems and organic golems; choose one such subrace.

            <p>Inorganic golems refer to beings that derive power and energy through man-made means. They are typically made of metal, plating, or other machinery. Such golems might be motorized and made sentient through steam power, electricity, artificing, or even technological magic (called technomancy).</p>
            <p>Inorganic golems are sometimes found throughout Piltover and Zaun, where the blooming culture of invention encourages their construction. Outside of these sister-cities, however, some debate the morality of creating life unnaturally.</p>
