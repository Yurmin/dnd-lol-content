        <description>
            <p class="flavor">Old as the universe and just as powerful, Celestials cross the boundaries of mortal possibility. With vast ranges of abilities, such as the power of creation, healing, or omniscience, Celestials demonstrate great providence over the physical realm. However, most Celestials are inhuman, bordering on eldritch in appearance, utterly disconnected from the mortals they ostensibly oversee. While most Celestials choose to remain in the Celestial Realm, content in their incomprehensibility, a select few decide to descend into the mortal realm. But these Celestials almost never come in their pure, godlike forms. Instead, they typically sacrifice some condition of their sublimity in order to better interact with mortals. Or, they may even imbue their essence within mortals, merging with someone worthy and willing.</p>
            <h4>Hands of Fate</h4>
            <p>Celestials are the weavers of destiny, with the power to guide fate toward its course. From the domain of the Celestial Realm, fully-powered Celestials exercise the breadth of their influence. Celestials, knowledgable in the different threads of fate, aim their efforts in preserving the multiverse's longevity. This might be interpreted as goodness or benevolence, but it is perhaps more accurate to acknowledge Celestial actions as being beyond mortal grasp. Indeed, some Celestials pursue more ambivalent strands and developments, such as creating change for change's sake.</p>
            <h4>Aspects and Visionaries</h4>
            <p>A specific type of Celestial exists, residing and originating in a plane called Targon Prime, known as Aspects. The Aspects personify a concept, such as war, justice, or change. These concepts evolve through mortal affairs. At times that necessitate widespread transformation, or if a mortal proves themselves worthy in the ritual of Ascension, an Aspect comes down and merges with a mortal. In this form, an Aspect can be destroyed by a being of equal power, or the Aspect may choose a different mortal host.</p>
            <h4>Humanity's Guardians</h4>
            <p>Some mortal faiths are based in the worship of Celestials. But most followers have not born witness to an actual Celestial, nor have they seen their direct influence. Nonetheless, Celestials may take a hands-on or hands-off approach to helping humans. Stories around Mount Targon spread of a Celestial who sacrificed her immortal, animalistic form and exchanged it for corporealityâ€”embracing all the weaknesses of humanity to better serve them. For all the cruelty of mortals, it seems there are entities dedicated to saving them.</p>
            <h4>Stellar Influence</h4>
            <p>Celestial agency takes different forms. The mythos of the creation of the Ascended claims that Celestials made them as weapons against the Void's corruption. Another type of Celestial exists, called Celestial dragons. These beings manipulate the stars and suns themselves. These dragons may explain the existence of celestial bodies and universes as creations by a higher being. In either case, Celestial power seems tied to the stars, and thus Celestials have appointed themselves as the guardians of all that the stars cover.</p>
            <h4>Celestial names</h4>
            <p>Celestial names are based in the language of Celestials. Names are oft derived from the names of celestial bodies, heavenly, grandiose, and carrying much weight. Due to their unearthly forms, names are not typically gendered.</p>

                </strong>
                Celestials are ageless creatures. However, by coming to the physical realm, they make themselves vulnerable; they can be destroyed through war, subjugation, or bloodshed.

After using this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a short or long rest. This dice changes when you reach certain levels. The die becomes 1d6 at 5th level, a 1d8 at 10th level, and a 1d10 at 15th level.
